        <p id="pos1">As everyone knows that <em> <strong>technology</strong> is growing rapidly and in these days technology is attracting new generation of this modern age</em>.In this article I would like to introduce you to some young programmers of this age.
First let me introduce myself. I am Kanat Turarbek and i am a student. Now Iwould like to say why i choose this topic, I love to read articles and recently I heard about many young programmers of this age, they are self taught .So thought to write a article on them and medium is best way to share our information with everyone on this planet.
Lets meet <strong>Tanmay Bakshi</strong>. He is a self-taught teenager <em>developer who developed several apps and source code</em> from the age of five. His parents immigrated from Delhi, India to Brampton, Canada in 2004 when he was one year old. Father Puneet Bakshi is a computer programmer. Mother Sumita is housewife. Tanmay is World’s Youngest IBM Watson Programmer. Now he’s a Computer programmer, artificial intelligence expert and all-around tech extraordinaire. He’s developed multiple apps, published a book, hosted a TEDx Talk and spoken at IBM Watson summits around the world including Finland, New Zealand, Denmark and Australia.
But there’s something surprising about him: He’s only 14 years old.
Though he first caught the attention of IBM at age 11, Bakshi’s rise in the tech industry began much earlier. While peers were stacking Legos and playing make-believe, a five-year-old Bakshi was learning how to code.
<em>His father Puneet Bakshi worked as a computer programmer</em> for a number of years. As the elder Bakshi typed out codes, his enthralled son watched the process.
Sensing this budding curiosity, his father taught him how to program. From there, Bakshi began using the internet on his own and reading books on programming.
At age seven, Bakshi set up a YouTube channel where he posted tutorials on coding and web development. With each video upload, he received thousands of questions from people all over the world.
He’s such a good inspiration to ones of his age.

    <p id="pos2">Almost one year ago, I began my new job as an associate <strong>software developer</strong> here at <em>Stack Overflow</em>. Before that, I’d been running the <em>Product Design team, first as a manager and then as director of design</em>. It’s admittedly an unconventional career change, but for me personally, it couldn’t have made more sense.

I’ve always loved figuring things out. The first time I remember feeling the problem-solving glow was in junior high in Algebra I. That giddiness that floods your stomach when you’ve been throwing your brain at something for a while, and then it finally clicks. In my senior year of college, I took an intro to computer science class as an elective with a friend out of curiosity. My friend hated it, but I remember sitting there thinking, there’s that feeling. It clicks.

Then that sort of simmered. I did a bit of front-end dev work at my first post-undergrad job (we’re talking basic HTML only). When I went back to school for Human-Computer Interaction, I got to do a bit more <em>coding, mostly just Java, Arduino stuff, and Adobe Flex [RIP]</em>, but never more than that. When I started working as a UX Researcher after grad school, I thought, “Well, this is your career now!”

I genuinely think that my problem, for years, has been confidence. I was just a UX person, not a coder. Surrounded by only the most freakishly good developers at Facebook (and then at Stack Overflow), I pushed whatever fantasies I had about coding professionally aside.</p>
